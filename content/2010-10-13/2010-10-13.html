Next CocoaHeads meeting will be [Thursday, October 14th](http://cocoaheads.org/us/PhiladelphiaPennsylvania/index.html) at [Indy Hall](http://indyhall.org).

This month, we're back to our regular meeting format. We'll have an update on the [The Ship It Society](http://shipitsociety.com/), a talk on AVFoundation, and whatever else comes up. There is still room in the agenda, so please let us know if you want to share something.

Comcast has graciously offered to sponsor this meeting. Thanks, Comcast!

Also don't forget, the [Voices That Matter iPhone Developer Conference](http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/iphone2010/) is this weekend in Philadelphia, and there is still space available.
