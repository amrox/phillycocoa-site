Once again, great turnout.  Thanks to everyone who participated!

### Cocoa Foundations Class Announcement ###

We officially announced the class, which is taking place next month.  Details can be found [here][cocoa-foundations].

### WWDC09 ###

Philly will have a much stronger showing at WWDC, as half of IndyHall is going.  We will organize at least one social meetup for Philly CocoaHeads people.  More details will come on the mailing list and the next CocoaHeads meeting in May.

### Show and Tell ###

Mike Zornek ([@zorn](http://twitter.com/zorn)) gave a great demo of his upcoming application, Profit Train, which is the successor to [Billable](http://clickablebliss.com/billable).  If you're interested in beta testing, get in touch with Mike.

Andy Mroczkowski ([@amrox](http://twitter.com/amrox)) showed off a little application he built to help out a friend, [FLVr Injector](http://amrox.github.com/flvrinjector).  FLVr Injector injects metadata into flash video (FLV) files and it built around the [yamdi](http://yamdi.sourceforge.net/) command-line tool.

Finally, Jason Laan demoed his web service, [Spreadmob](http://app.spreadmob.com/) which allows developers to quickly create a web presence for their iPhone apps, and add other social features.

### Next Meeting - May 14th 2009 ###

Our [next meeting][2] is May 14th, 7-9P and [IndyHall][3].  The agenda is to be determined.
