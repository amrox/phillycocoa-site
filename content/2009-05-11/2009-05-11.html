Next CocoaHeads meeting is Thursday, May 13th at Indy HallÂ Classic (same place, new (temporary) name)
[link](http://cocoaheads.org/us/PhiladelphiaPennsylvania/index.html).

A lot is going on this month.  We're halfway through the [Cocoa Foundations Workshop](classes/cocoa-foundations/), so expect an update from that.  Also, Dave Martorana will talk about some fancy Objective-C/WebKit integration.

If you are interested in sharing or presenting something, don't be shy!  If you have something cool to show or talk about, we'd love to hear about it.
