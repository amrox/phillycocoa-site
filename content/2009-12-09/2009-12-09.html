Next CocoaHeads meeting is [Thursday, December 10th](http://cocoaheads.org/us/PhiladelphiaPennsylvania/index.html) at [Indy Hall](http://indyhall.org).

We don't have any scheduled talks this month.  Instead we'll do a year in review, as well as discussing what we'd like to do the following year.  Come with thoughts and ideas, or just come to hang out.  They'll likely be food and beers involved.

### Agenda ###

- Meet & Greet - Communicate with other humans using the high bandwidth "face-to-face" protocol.
- General News
- Social Hour
