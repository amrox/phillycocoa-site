Next CocoaHeads meeting will be [Thursday, July 8th](http://cocoaheads.org/us/PhiladelphiaPennsylvania/index.html) at [Indy Hall](http://indyhall.org).

This month, we'll still be unpacking information from WWDC. Topics on the agenda are AVFoundation, as well as some discussion of new development tools. Also, we'll take a look back at the Philly Beer Week app, some lessons learned, and some directions moving forward.

As PhillyCocoa expands, it will be helpful to us and our hosts, Indy Hall to get a rough head count for each meeting.

**Please [RSVP for the July 2010 meeting](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dExpcTF6dTRTZ1d5QzlCVHliS05QSkE6MQ).**
