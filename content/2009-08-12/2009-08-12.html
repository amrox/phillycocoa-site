[Next CocoaHeads meeting](http://cocoaheads.org/us/PhiladelphiaPennsylvania/index.html) is [Thursday, August 13th](http://cocoaheads.org/us/PhiladelphiaPennsylvania/index.html) at Indy HallÂ Classic (same place, new (temporary) name).

Our first Philadelphia CocoaHeads meeting was in August of 2008, so this marks PhillyCocoa's first birthday (woo). To celebrate, we'll have some extra snacks and refreshments along with our regularly scheduled awesome content.  We're also [accepting donations](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/5590) to fund this event, and keep PhillyCocoa going strong.  It's not too late to pledge!

This month, Philip Fominykh will give a talk about using Common Lisp on Mac technology.  Lisp is a very old and influential language which helped inspire SmallTalk, and it turn, Objective-C.  It should be really interesting. 

Also we'll have some updates on other things going on, such as the iPhone Deviation events.
