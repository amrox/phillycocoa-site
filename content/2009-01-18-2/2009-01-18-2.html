Thanks again to everyone for participating in an awesome first meeting of 2009!

After introductions, we dove into a brainstorming session about what we want to do with the group in the short term.  We decided that it would be a great idea to start working on a hands-on project to help everyone get some common ground.  A calculator seemed like a logical first project, so we paired up, dove in and started building it.

Over the next few meetings (or until we get tired of it), we'll continue to build on the calculator application.  Each week, we'll try to focus on a particular aspect or Cocoa topic, and build it right into the application on the spot.  After the meeting someone (me for now) will gather everyone's work and post it in some shared repository.  This will also help those who can't make a particular meeting catch up if needed.

### Project Calculator ###

This week's work on Project Calculator merely involved getting newcomers familiar with Cocoa and the Xcode environment.  Some groups progressed further than others into real implementation.

__IMPORTANT__ If you developed any code, please send it to the mailing list or directly to me.  I want to get it posted somehow, somewhere well in advance of the next meeting.  I'll be sending out the temporary location for the code my team built shortly.

### Next Meeting - February 12 2009 ###

The infamous Far McKon is going to give a preview of some things he's been working on in the Neat Company Labs.

Then we'll kick off part 2 of Project Calculator.  Themes and topics TBA.  Please share your interests or feedback!

### Website & Code Repository ###

If you have any input or thoughts on what kind of website or shared repository we should use, let me know.  Otherwise I'm gonna dive in and make it happen.
