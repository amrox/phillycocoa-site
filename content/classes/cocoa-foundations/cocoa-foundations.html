# Objective-C & Cocoa Foundation Framework

### Tickets: [phillycocoa.ticketleap.com](http://phillycocoa.ticketleap.com)

The first in a series of educational events, this is a foundational overview of the Objective-C language and the core foundation objects you'll use in the Cocoa framework. Targeted at those who are new to the platform this will lay the ground work for your programming future, be it iPhone development or desktop applications on Mac OS X.

## When and Where

The event will consist of two consecutive Saturdays, Sat May 9th and Sat May 16th. The class itself will begin at 1pm and end at approximately 5pm (with some more social time afterwards). 

**Location:**  
[Indy Hall](http://www.indyhall.org/)  
32 Strawberry Street,  
Philadelphia, PA 19106

## Cost

The total cost for the event is $100. With this you'll be able to attend both Saturdays and get a copy of the companion book [Learn Objective–C on the Mac](http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430218150). Early signups can pick up their book early at Indy Hall. For more info on the book talk to Jason Allum <jallum@gmail.com>.

## Expectations

Attendees should come with a basic understanding of procedural programming. Previous object-oriented experience a plus but not required.

Attendees should come with a laptop running OS X Leopard and the latest version of the development tools. If you need help installing the tools let us know. If you don't have a laptop let us know; we may be able to have one for you to use in class.

## Class details

The class itself while not based exactly on the companion book, [Learn Objective–C on the Mac](http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430218150), does draw heavily from it. Class time will be a ping pong match of overview and hands-on exercises. During the hands-on exercises instructors will browse the class to help anyone having trouble.
