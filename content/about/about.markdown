PhillyCocoa is (as the tagline suggests) a Philadelphia area Mac and iPhone programming group. All skill levels are welcome. The only requirement is an interest in Mac-related technologies and moderate tolerance for Apple nerds.

The current organizer of PhillyCocoa is [Andy Mroczkowski](http://mrox.net).
