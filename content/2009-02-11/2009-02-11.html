Next CocoaHeads meeting is Thursday, February 12th at Indy Hall 
[link](http://cocoaheads.org/us/PhiladelphiaPennsylvania/index.html).

### Agenda ###

After group introductions, Michael Zornek ([@zorn][1]) has volunteered to give a brief overview of [JRFeedbackProvider][2].

Following, we will break out into groups to continue work on [Project Calculator][3] (or code that you brought with you if you prefer).

### Project Calculator Starting Point ###

A [starting point][4] for the Calculator project has been posted on github.  It is based [@jallum][5]'s group's work from last meeting.  The current trunk version now does basic integer arithmetic.

See you there!
