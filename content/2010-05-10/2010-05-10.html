Next CocoaHeads meeting will be [Thursday, May 13th](http://cocoaheads.org/us/PhiladelphiaPennsylvania/index.html) at [Indy Hall](http://indyhall.org).

WWDC is coming up, and the release of iPhone OS 4 is right around the corner. This month we'll be talking about "new stuff" that may or may not be related to the aformentioned iPhone OS release.
