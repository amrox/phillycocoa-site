The [source](http://github.com/amrox/phillycocoa-site/tree/master) *and*
[content](http://github.com/amrox/phillycocoa-site/tree/gh-pages) for
[phillycocoa.org](http://phillycocoa.org) are now hosted on 
GitHub, using the [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) feature. Static HTML
content is generated using [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) version
2.2.2, though we are considering migrating to
[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  The site's design was
intentionally [primitive](http://www.freecsstemplates.org/preview/primitive), 
but if you'd like to see a facelift, patches are welcome.
