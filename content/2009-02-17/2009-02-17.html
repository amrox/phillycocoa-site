### Learning Cocoa ###

We are beginning to gather ideas about how to best serve the growing population of attendees who are new to Cocoa.  A lightweight Cocoa “class” is being considered, but we need feedback on content, structure, and schedule from our target audience.

Please visit the [PhillyCocoa Google group][phillycocoa_group] to contribute to the discussion.
