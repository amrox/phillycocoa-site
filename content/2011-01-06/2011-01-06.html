Next CocoaHeads meeting will be [Thursday, January 13th](http://cocoaheads.org/us/PhiladelphiaPennsylvania/index.html) 7pm at [Indy Hall](http://indyhall.org).

The Mac App Store is out! We'll have a little round table discussion to see how it's being received. Mike Zornek will give a short talk about CorePlot which is being used in the upcoming Ship It Society exercise / video game for iPhone. 

In addition to being an open mic to demo new apps or code, Show and Tell this month will be expanded, inviting people to bring problems or design issues they are encountering in current project.
