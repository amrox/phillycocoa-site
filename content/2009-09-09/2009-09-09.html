[Next CocoaHeads meeting](http://cocoaheads.org/us/PhiladelphiaPennsylvania/index.html) is [Thursday, September 10th](http://cocoaheads.org/us/PhiladelphiaPennsylvania/index.html) at Indy Hall (**NEW LOCATION**).

After much discussion, we sorted out the location situation, and we're staying at [Indy Hall](http://indyhall.org)!  The location is just a few blocks away from where we previously met.
