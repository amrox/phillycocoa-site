Next CocoaHeads meeting will be [Thursday, December 9th](http://cocoaheads.org/us/PhiladelphiaPennsylvania/index.html) at [Indy Hall](http://indyhall.org).

This month we're going to continue the tradition of doing a year-end celebration and a look into the upcoming year. We'll leave room for General News and Show and Tell, but no (mini) talks. Instead we'll discuss some upcoming changes and where we want to take PhillyCocoa/CocoaHeads in light of those changes. These are exciting times.

If you care about PhillyCocoa at all - past, present, and future - this is a meeting you really don't want to miss.

**Please [RSVP for the December 2010 meeting](https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/phillycocoa.org/viewform?formkey=dGZKSkhLcGoyeFE1cWVjUUVHclJCaVE6MA#gid=0).**
